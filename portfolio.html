  <h2>HomeWork 1: Instagram</h2>
  <p>We were tasked with replicating a basic web-page by Instagram. This was my first time using CSS for quite a few months and I found the project a particular challenge. CSS loves not to behave. Overall it took about 3 hours, I was reasonably happy with the result, even though I felt the css was quite hacky and full of errors (probably).</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 2: Calculator</h2>
  <p>We were instructed to make a basic calculator taking the input of the alert bar in the browser. This was my first true javascript programming, I found it a real challenge but enjoyed working through the logic of it. In the end I completed the basic calculator, plus some extra features which would calculate monthly mortgage payments, and a body's BMI. I did not have time to work on a trip-calculator, with an output of fuel efficiency.</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 3: Advanced Calculator</h2>
  <p>We were asked to build another calculator which would not use the alert bars for the input. So we had to use document.getElementById to retrieve values input by the user. I achieved this relatively easy. After I created a calculator which actually looks like a calculator with the buttons etc. This was a real challenge for me, the styling was easy, but figuring out how to break adding to the variable number after pressing a calculation function was difficult. In the end I managed it, however it only worked for one calculation i.e. 2x2 etc.</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 4:Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
  <p>We were asked to build a tic-tac-toe game for player against player, and if that was managed to build an computer to play against. It took me a weekend to figure out the logic of the game, but was managed eventually. I did not have time to build any computer AI. After the calculator this was a bit step up in logic, but an enjoyable challenge.</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 5: Daft Punk Audio</h2>
  <p>We were provided with a variety of DaftPunk audio files and design a website which would play them when the mouse was hovered over the sound-files. This was an enjoyable project and completed easily after the tic-tac-toe challenge. It is the first time I have ever used audio files in a webPage.</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 6: Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
  <p>We were asked to build a rock-paper-scissors program to play against. I found this relatively challenging getting the logic right. I found styling the css easy, so definitely feel I am getting better at that. The logic of javascript I still struggle with quite a bit, but when I figure out the logic it is fantastic. This was produced with a variety of a switch statement, event listeners, and if functions.</p>
  <h2>HomeWork 7: jQuery Twitter</h2>
  <p>We were introduced to jQuery for the first time. I have used jQuery in the past and not liked it, so always swayed towards using plain javascript. With the brief introduction to jQuery I really struggled with this homework and only managed to get it partially done, the first time on the course so very annoyed with myself. When we were shown the solution it seemed so obviously easy.</p>
  <h2>Project 1: PolitiCat</h2>
  <p>We were given four days to build a website from scratch for a game, any game we wanted. I decided to build a game based on duckHunt, but rather than have a click on the moving target, I wanted to make the programming a little more difficult and have to fire an object at the other object, so the program would have to detect a collision. The first two days of the project was very difficult, it was a bit step up from the previous homework efforts, and required a lot of online research. I also decided to build it primarily using jQuery to improve my skills of it. By the end I was very happy with the design and functionality of the game. Perhaps the game could use some levels, and lives to make it more enjoyable to play, but for a project done in four days and having only learned JavaScript full-time for two weeks, I was pleased.</p>
