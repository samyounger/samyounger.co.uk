			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">An interest in finance</span></a></h2>
			<p>I became interested in finance at an early age. At 17 I did an internship at a small Edinburgh legal company which had an asset management subsidiary. After the weeks introduction to 'the world of finance', I set up an execution-only online trading account to make my first investment. I was immediately hooked, and I have maintained interest in finance ever since</p>
			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">University</span></a></h2>
			<p>I went to Aberdeen university where I studied Geography. Four years of studying, partying, hockey, and making great friends it was a fantastic four years. At the end I came out with an Ma Hons in Geography, with smatterings of Russian, French, and Geology. Not that I could speak either of those languages fluently now.</p>
			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">First job</span></a></h2>
			<p>I graduated from university in 2007. This was just as the world was entering a significant global recession. All companies knew it was coming and so all graduate schemes had shut down. I ended up getting a job with a small stock-broker firm called Killik & Co, which was the result of applying to 87 investment management companies.</p>
			<p>Killik & Co was a sharp introduction to the world of work. The first telephone calls I took from clients they were asking which bank their cash was kept and how safe it was. It was a hard time to begin a career in finance but made me an extra cautionary investor as a result, all for the better in my opinion. For 5 years I give clients advice investing in Stocks, Bonds, & Funds. I left eventually as I felt the job was inefficient and regulation was making the business model of advisory broking less viable by the year, and so I moved to a discretionary asset management firm Sarasin & Partners where I currently work.</p>
			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">My current job</span></a></h2>
			<p>At Sarasin & Partners I work in a team of three where we manage two Funds, and a collection of private clients. There is significantly less client contact which in theory should mean there is more time to focus on markets and research, but unfortunately again because of regulation the administration and compliance constraints are substantial.</p>
			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">Career evaluation</span></a></h2>
			<p>In the wake of the financial crisis there has been a great deal of negative public sentiment surrounding the sector, which has resulted in increased regulation. Companies have responded by expanding compliance departments which are costly. In my job I have to spend half my day working on administration and fulfilling compliance requirements. To create anything new it has to be run by compliance, and involves a lot of stress and argument to force change. Finance lacks creativity, entrapreneurialism, and an appetite for risk which I believe is required to take the industry to the next step - automate administration & compliance thereby reducing costs & increasing day-to-day efficiency i.e. analysing markets. This should reduce costs for clients, and improve the service level.</p>
			<h2><a href="#"><span class="underline">Forward looking</span></a></h2>
			<p>This catches me up to the present. Eventually I want to start my own company which will automate the repeatable parts of my job such as administration, compliance, valuations, performance calculation, payments, 'suitability documents'. It is an ambitious plan and one I expect will take me many years and significant amounts of help from other seasoned technology professionals to develop the platform. However given financial constraints I want to design the first minimal viable product myself which may take me a year or two, before bringing in more seasoned coding professionals. To get to this level I want to learn to code myself to a professional level as quickly as possible. I have already coded for one year to explore my interest in it an ensure it wasn't a passing fad. The more I have learnt, the more I have enjoyed it and my understanding of its potential increased my interest - a virtuous circle.</p>
