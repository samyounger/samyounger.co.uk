#Application for General Assembly

When I applied to attend the General Assembly course to start on the 8th August 2016 they asked me to make a personal website to demonstrate all that I knew about web development. This was the product of that project.

This is the first proper project I did using SASS. It is manually compiled using the terminal.

The project also uses jQuery with a drop-drown plugin.

The whole project if I recall correctly took about a week doing an hour or two each night after work. I thoroughly enjoyed the project, and spent most of the time focused on the short amount of Javascript and SASS.
